-methods that contain ! usually mutate the caller
-? used in a method usually signify the method will return a boolean value
-these are actual parts of method names and not part of ruby syntax 


1. != means not equal to. Can use as a condition

2. '!' used before a value changes to its opposite boolean value
  
3. this is a convention used in naming methods that are destructive
  
4. this may signify a ternary operator 
   ex: a ? b : c

5. ? after a method usually signifies the method will return a boolean

6. !! this will turn whatever is follwing into its boolean value, regardless
   of what type of object it is
